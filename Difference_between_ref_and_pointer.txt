What is the difference between Reference Variable and Pointer?

1. Pointer
-> Pointer can be initialized any time.
-> A pointer can be pointed to another object anytime.
-> Seperate memory is allocated 
-> Pointer can be dereferenced using dereference(*) operator
-> Makes execution slower
-> Pointe can point to nowhere(NULL)

2. Reference Variable
-> A reference must be initialized when it is created.
-> It can not be referred to another object or to be changed once it is initialized
-> No seperate memory is allocated
-> It can be dereferenced automatically
-> It will always referred to an object (Never Null)
-> Makes execution faster.
